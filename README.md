# Christmas-List-Application-Development

setup:
1. Set up an apache webserver and add the php directory to the www directory (I suggest downloading wampserver if on windows to try this app).
2. Make sure to configure the apache webserver to connect to devices on the LAN.
2. open the christmas list directory in android studio.
3. Make sure to change the IP address for each usage in the projects (press ctrl shift r to refactor all occurances of 10.0.0.236 in the code to your ip address).
4. run the app.
